# PrimeNumberCounter Project - TDD

This is my first project using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, where I created a program that counts and sums **prime numbers** between 0 and 1000.

## Features
- **Prime Identification**: Checks if a number is prime.
- **Prime Counting**: Counts how many primes there are up to a given number.
- **Prime Summation**: Adds up all the primes in the range.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input is valid (between 0 and 1000).

## TDD Process
- **Red**: I wrote tests first, which initially failed.
- **Green**: I wrote code to make the tests pass.
- **Refactor**: I improved the code without breaking the tests.

## Testing
I used **JUnit 5** to test the program, checking for:
- Correct prime logic.
- Valid and invalid inputs.
- Correct outputs.

Test coverage is over 80%, ensuring the program works well.

## Conclusion
This project helped me learn TDD and how to write tests for better, more reliable code.
